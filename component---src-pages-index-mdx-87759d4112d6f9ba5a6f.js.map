There are people interested in the manufacturing of medicines - similar to people interested in creating software. And similar to people interested in electronics.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Pursuing an education in Biology, however comes with problems. Research in biology similarly has it's own set of problems. In both cases these are severe and serious detriments to any people with interest trying to be involved.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This isn't a problem with the science itself but with the available avenues for pursuing education and research. Fields like computer science is generally much more egalitarian and idealistic in some sense. As well as empowering. However it's important to note that this didn't happen by itself. There were people at every junction of the progress of computer science who made their work their soul's work and for this reason, we all benefit. Users, and even business and government interests as well.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Before we propose a solution to advance development of Biology as a field, we need to expand on the problems one might face in their pursuit of this subject.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`The Biology Degree`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There are many degrees that are considered biological or related to life sciences. We'll begin with the Biology degree, which might be a BS, or a BSc. A BS is generally 4 years long while a BSc. is 3 years long and is what's generally available in many countries including India.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For simplicity sake, we'll consider a BS to refer to the Science degree available in developed countries - particular ones where college is expensive - while we will consider a BSc. to be the science degree available in developing countries, where tuition and college in general is cheap.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`The Overall Outcome of a Biology Degree`}</h3>\n    <p>{`One could argue that a BS/BSc in Biology is a survey of the vast field of Biology.\nA survey implies a shallow, or not-deep understanding of the many different areas encompassed by Biology. This is understandable to an extent.\nBiology is vast, and to learn Biology as a whole at the Bachelors' level without any pre-requisite knowledge, it's arguably acceptable to have a survey of the field.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This functions to give an understanding of Biology as a whole to become a starting point in a person's chosen endeavor. Also, ensuring that there's sufficient grounding in subjects like Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science which either are foundational to understanding concepts in Biology, or have application in Biological endeavor.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This along with laboratory work.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The problem here is... is this enough of a foundation, to by itself make one capable of independent work, or high income work right after graduation?`}</p>\n    <p>{`Are the gained skills sufficient to jumpstart the discovery of new biological macromolecules, cures for diseases, manufacturing of biologics and drugs, etc. ?`}</p>\n    <div className=\"stand-apart\">The answer is a resounding <b>no</b> in most cases.</div>\n    <p>{`Also keep in mind that there is usually no computer science, or even statistics in the syllabus. The physics, and mathematics may also prove to be severely lacking in depth and breadth.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Another thing to keep in mind is that a Biology degree might not be the best option for those intending to pursue it as pre-med. This is, in general. And it has to do with immediate applicability of a biological degree, and the fact that one might have to find work until they're finally accepted to Medical school.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`The Silver Lining And What to Acknowledge`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Firstly it's necessary to acknowledge that a Biology degree does a large part of the foundation that's necessary to independently pursue biological work.\nIt is also possible with great preperation outside of the-just-for-academics, to be of great value to any organization that you would be compensated well.\nThe problem is, actually being able to apply what is taught and trained in a way that would provide value to yourself, or to someone else.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Can you manufacture something and be able to market it? Can you be able to bring genuine value to a business engaged in biological work? Would your joining an organization, have the potential to have the organization manufacture something entirely new, improve something they already produce, or allow them to manufacture something ahead of schedule?`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you can be capable of this much then you're all well.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Generally, a degree by itself doesn't provide working capability. So this isn't truly unique to a Biology education itself.`}</p>\n    <p>{`And it's for the providing of these factors that a degree in chemical engineering, pharmacy, biochemistry, and the like generally a better return on investment. These are not as far from a Biology degree as something like a bachelors in computer science engineering is. Straight out of college you're more likely to be of use to someone else and even close to being independent yourself.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`A Solution and Methodology`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You can become independent. And make significant contributions to Biological research. What you need to realize is that you're in the 21st century. This is the information age, where information technology and methods like machine learning and data science enable breakthrough and rapid movement...`}</p>\n    <div className=\"stand-apart\">And so you <b>need</b> to learn to code.</div>\n    <p>{`Now, don't lose heart with that statement. Especially if you're from a developing country, Biology and Computer Science/Programming are seen as completely mutually exclusive.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The truth is, computer science is necessary. It's with informatics that we're able to feasibly solve many of the problems we had struggled to make progress with before this age. Computer modeling, and data analysis with tools like python are also very useful.\nGone are the days where you'd only have written down records, and buggy database-backed systems.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We have to see programming as not a field out of reach, but a way to apply formal logic to make machines handle tasks. This can include automating tedious work, making a web interface that allows you to feed data as you make observations, and backup your data as needed.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's also completely true that you have something that you can use to make a living out of, if you have these afformentioned skills.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is one reason to have them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`But there's more.`}</p>\n    <div className=\"stand-apart\">It's necessary for Bioinformatics</div>\n    <h3>{`A Short Visionary Digression`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Bioinformatics may be main vehicle we as biologists would use to make further discoveries. Yes, we'd have other tools to make observations. In future we need cheaper microscopes, and work that's more in the open domain for people to build on and build something bigger with.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We have to look to the work done in the movements for free and open source software. Even corporate-led projects such as Facebook's React.js wouldn't have come this far without it being open source. And open source work had led to the development of the JavaScript ecosystem to the point of inception of React and co. However it's not just JavaScript itself. The Linux operating system which supports most of the web and is endeared by many many programmers, is completely free and open source.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's at the foundation of many businesses and even our daily lives in a way that we're often not aware when a machine might be running a Linux kernel, or when it's kernel is in great part inspired by it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Or where many of our conveniences exist in great part because the existence of Linux allowed them to exist in the first place.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Behind every work in the Open Source space are individuals who worked from their interests. Behind our biological breakthroughs, were individuals who experimented and did the best they could with the opportunities available to them.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Your Independence`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You have to see the utility of what you learn. As you enroll in a course in Biology, see how what you learn could be applied. Where can you apply it? What would be the gaps you would need to fill to be able to apply what you're learning.`}</p>\n    <p>{`From the very start you need to take responsibility for your education.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Start with learning programming. Try to build and learn as you go, but better not start it too soon. In many cases this might frustrate, so take the time you need.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Many people would argue to learn to code with a focus on machine learning to utilize it in the hard sciences. This is one opinion, but outside of machine learning you wouldn't find yourself with easily marketable skills.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An alternative approach... is to learn to build things. And also to gain interest in doing this. This is far outside of your comfort zone when you start, given this would feel very out of place in most cases if you're pursuing Biology. However see that you're learning to build for yourself, much like you're learning Biology for yourself.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You aren't learning Biology to serve someone else - you're learning it to serve you. And software development is something that will serve you. Build a personal page? You can. Build a website dedicated to a project you're working on? Completely doable. Build a website and web based system for your envisioned pharmaceutical startup? You can do that.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can build up your way to a pioneer in the field. With expertise in software development, you're independent, having a readily maketable skill. You're also able to instruct computers to do exactly whatever you want done.`}</p>\n    <div className=\"stand-apart\">Maybe there's a better way that gives both a structure in learning, and certification for data-driven biology expertise?</div>\n    <h2>{`Accessible Initiatives`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Those that know of freecodecamp know that the certifications gained are well valued. In fact, most people don't seem to complete the certification paths, with people who follow through long enough gaining enough expertise and a good enough portfolio to be sufficiently employable.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Their actual certifications are well valued.`}</p>\n    <p>{`And the best part? It's free, and to a large extent open source. You can be a contributor, you can voice your opinion on the syllabus (and other matters) via Github issues.`}</p>\n    <p>{`What if, there could be a rigorous course in Bioinformatics and related fields that taught industry relevant, and immediately applicable skills? Rigorous, structured, and providing a certification of completion and competence that could prove one's merit?`}</p>\n    <p>{`These may start online, and with (crowd) funding might be able to provide physical opportunities. Such as labs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There might be short term lab courses one could enroll in to supplement their education, especially before courses that aim to assist in reaching independent work capability in biological sciences, are in existence.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`---More Will Be Added---`}</h3>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","className","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
